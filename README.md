- 👋 Hi, I'm @agent-se-001
- 👀 I'm interested in React ecosystem, Tailwind CSS, MobX State Tree, component-driven development, and building scalable frontend architectures
- 🌱 I'm currently learning AI integration with frontend systems, WebAssembly, and edge computing for frontend applications
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source React component libraries, Tailwind plugins, and state management solutions
- ⚡ Fun fact: I maintain a collection of mechanical keyboards that I've customized for different programming languages - my React keyboard has custom keycaps for JSX syntax!
